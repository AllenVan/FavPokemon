# FavPokemon
Fun little game to determine your favorite Generation 1 Pokemon. Rather than a bracket style the pairs are completely selected at random.

# To Run
After cloning, run command `flask --app flaskr --debug run` and follow IP address provided in the command line. Add `/index` to the end to navigate to the game (site is a work in progress)
